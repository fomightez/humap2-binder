***humap2-binder:  Jupyter notebook environment for analysis of hu.MAP 2.0-related data.***

A launchable, working Jupyter-based environment that has a collection of demonstrations of analysis of hu.MAP 2.0-related data served via MyBinder.org.

You can also easily adapt the demonstrations to analyze your favorite proteins or create reports featuring your proteins of interest.

Meant to be self-contained and ready-to-go. No installations or copying of notebooks is necessary if `launch binder` is clicked. Everything will just work. Of course, static versions of the notebooks can also be used. I recommend rendering the static versions by placing the URLs into the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). The views provided by [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) look best and Github's rendering often times out (your mileage may vary).

[My humap3-binder repository](https://github.com/fomightez/humap3-binder) is where most of the related effort takes place, and will continue to take place, as it is where I started adding programmatic access to the hu.MAP-related data, and so be sure to see there for more beyond what you find here. Importantly, I realized that myself and others might be curious how the author-provided data has changed between the two versions, and so this repository serves as a foundation for wrangling the hu.MAP 2.0-related data. It will parallel the current state of [the humap3-binder repository](https://github.com/fomightez/humap3-binder), although that one is expected to expand soon using the foundation provided here to allow comparison between the results.
